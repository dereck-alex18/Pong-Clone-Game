This project is a Pong Clone Game (Atari 1972). The game consists of one "arena", one ball and 2 paddles, where each paddle is controlled by a player. The player, who scores 5 points, wins the match.
The game was built in HTML and JavaScript along with P5 library, which is a JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of Processing.

The following are the controls to play the game:

    W =====> Move upwards the left paddle,
    S =====> Move downwards the left paddle,
    UP_ARROW =====> Move upwards the right paddle,
    DOWN_ARROW =====> Move downwards the right paddle
    P =====> Pause and unpause the game.

When the match ends, a message is displayed showing who won it and then another match is started automatically.
